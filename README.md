# Vocational-Training-from-TATA-STEEL
I would like to express my heartiest gratitude to my guide, Mr. Manish Kumar (Manager QA& LP) for guiding me throughout my vocational training at TATA Steel Limited. Though the training was entirely through online mode, he was always there to help me through my doubts and guide me through various core concepts of metallurgy, steel making and TMT manufacturing.
The training was a great exposure to know how things read in textbooks are implemented in the industry.
One more thing worth mentioning is the core values on which TATA Steelworks, providing an equal and unbiased opportunity to every individual and also a good work-life balance. 
It was a pleasure working with such an organization and I will be looking forward to be a part of it even in the future.
